## The Hermes Framework: A Simple Explanation

Imagine a large, busy kitchen with many chefs (data teams) trying to cook different dishes (data products) for customers (business users). Right now, every chef has their own set of tools, their own recipes, and their own way of getting ingredients. This creates a few big problems:

*   **It's Messy and Inefficient:** With so many different processes, it's hard to keep track of everything. It takes a long time to prepare a new dish because each chef has to start from scratch.
*   **It's Hard to Ensure Quality:** With everyone doing their own thing, it's difficult to make sure every dish meets the same high standard.
*   **It's Expensive:** The kitchen needs to buy and maintain many different sets of tools, and a lot of time is wasted on repetitive tasks.

### What is the Hermes Framework?

The Hermes framework is like building a brand-new, state-of-the-art, standardized kitchen for all the chefs. Instead of a chaotic collection of individual setups, Hermes provides a single, unified system that makes cooking faster, easier, and more reliable.

Here are the main goals of this new kitchen:

1.  **One Set of Tools for Everyone:** Hermes provides a standard set of high-quality tools (software) that all chefs can use. This means everyone is working with the same equipment, which makes it easier to train new chefs and ensure consistency.

2.  **Standardized Recipes (Configuration):** Instead of writing a whole new recipe from scratch every time, chefs can now use pre-built templates (JSON configurations). They just need to fill in the specific ingredients and steps for their dish. This is like having a recipe card where you just fill in the blanks, rather than writing the whole thing out by hand.

3.  **A Clear Assembly Line (Data Flow):** Hermes creates a clear, step-by-step process for preparing every dish. This
